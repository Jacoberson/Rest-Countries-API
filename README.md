## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned
I learned how to use Tailwind CSS. I much prefer it to vanilla CSS. I also learned how to implement a dark mode toggle and how to use Next.js.

### Continued development
I'm still working towards being extremely comfortable with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Dark Mode Toggle](https://dev.to/thomasledoux1/easy-way-to-use-dark-mode-in-next-js-tailwind-2ob1) - This helped me implement a dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS and Next.js
